# JavaBitRead

## Introduction

This is a small proyect that I created in half an afternoon as a result of exploring several ideas I have been thinking about for a while now...

It started as some useful snippets for reading and writing files, but I developed this simple app integrating some features from my bit snippets at *Gitlab*.

## Description & usage

This chaotic mess reads files and writes the binary representation of its bytes into a log (by default. There is a method for spitting all that shit by console, if you want to render your cmd useless for some time while you look like a **complete h4x0r™**)

As you can see, I got lazy midways and it's not as interactive as I would have liked it to be. Nevertheless, launch the app with cmd and pass the file as an arg, and you *should* be fine. **Good enough™.**
